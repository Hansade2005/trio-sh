            **Author:** Hans Ade
            
            ---
            
            ### 🌟 Introducing Trio
            
            Trio is a revolutionary AI-powered app builder that puts you in full control. Unlike cloud-based competitors, Trio runs **locally on your machine**—delivering unmatched speed, privacy, and flexibility. Whether you’re a developer, designer, or entrepreneur, Trio empowers you to create, iterate, and launch apps and websites by simply chatting with AI.
            
            ---
            
            ### ✨ Why Choose Trio Over Lovable.dev, Bolt.new, and v0.dev?
            
            - **Truly Local & Private:**  
              Your ideas, code, and data never leave your device. No vendor lock-in, no cloud dependency, and no privacy trade-offs. Trio is built for creators who value control and confidentiality.
            
            - **Bring Your Own AI Keys:**  
              Use your own API keys for OpenAI, Anthropic, Google Gemini, Mistral, Groq, and more. You’re never locked into a single provider or forced to pay platform markups.
            
            - **Cross-Platform Freedom:**  
              Trio runs natively on Windows and Mac (Linux support coming soon). No sign-up, no friction—just download and start building.
            
            - **Open Source & Extensible:**  
              Trio is Apache 2.0-licensed and welcomes community contributions. You can inspect, extend, and trust every line of code.
            
            - **No Gimmicks, No Waiting:**  
              Unlike cloud tools that throttle, queue, or restrict your builds, Trio gives you instant, unlimited access to all features—forever.
