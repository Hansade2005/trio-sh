### 🌟 Introducing Trio

Trio is a revolutionary AI-powered app builder that puts you in full control. Unlike cloud-based competitors, Trio runs **locally on your machine**—delivering unmatched speed, privacy, and flexibility. Whether you’re a developer, designer, or entrepreneur, Trio empowers you to create, iterate, and launch apps and websites by simply chatting with AI.

### ✨ Why Choose Trio Over Lovable.dev, Bolt.new, and v0.dev?

- **Truly Local & Private:**  
  Your ideas, code, and data never leave your device. No vendor lock-in, no cloud dependency, and no privacy trade-offs. Trio is built for creators who value control and confidentiality.

- **Bring Your Own AI Keys:**  
  Use your own API keys for OpenAI, Anthropic, Google Gemini, Mistral, Groq, and more. You’re never locked into a single provider or forced to pay platform markups.

- **Cross-Platform Freedom:**  
  Trio runs natively on Windows and Mac (Linux support coming soon). No sign-up, no friction—just download and start building.

- **Open Source & Extensible:**  
  Trio is Apache 2.0-licensed and welcomes community contributions. You can inspect, extend, and trust every line of code.

- **No Gimmicks, No Waiting:**  
  Unlike cloud tools that throttle, queue, or restrict your builds, Trio gives you instant, unlimited access to all features—forever.
